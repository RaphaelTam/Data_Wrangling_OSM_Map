Open Street Map data from http://www.openstreetmap.org is shaped to a data model, changed to json format and stored in Mongo DB.

Data is audited for consistency and uniformity.  "audit_OSM.ipynb" is the project report.

In auditing the data, a number of output files are produced to reveal the extent of 
inconsistencies and lack of uniformity.  These are:
st_types
problem_addr.csv
cuisine_types
updated_cuisine_types

To view the report, copy the audit_OSM.ipynb link on github and paste it to the input box 
at http://nbviewer.ipython.org.  Hit Go!
